        WHO I AM
        <p>

          I go by Norman or Norm, whichever you prefer. The reason I wanted to create this website is to showcase my different interests that vary from time to time.
          "Jack of all trades, master of none"? Maybe, but I am a firm believer that you should try the things that interest you
          at an early age to figure out what you like before you get older and take on more responsibilities.
          My interests that I try to do on a daily basis includes(but not limited to): videography, photography, music, soccer, learning to play the piano,
           working out, and kicking it back with friends.

          <br> <br>"When you learn, teach. When you get, give."  <br>-Maya Angelou<br><br>
          
          I like to be around people, I like learning about everyone's story, and I like the meaningful connection that can be formed with others.
          I am fortunate to have met people who have taken me under their wing and have taught me lessons that will resonate with me wherever I go.

          <br><br>
          I've learned that it's ok to take risks, it's ok to mess up, and it's ok to do the opposite of everyone else is doing.
          I have spent so much time trying to fit in with everyone else that now I am trying to fit out. I would say that 
          some of my ambitions and goals aren't what every 21 year old wants; in which, I am completely fine with that 
          because it is about what you want, not your family or friends. Although, I am thankful to have family and friends
          that support my goals.

          <br><br>
          I am currently 21 years old and I hope this gave you a little take of the person that I am.
