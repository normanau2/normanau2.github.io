        WHO AM I
        <p>
          I am a Systems Engineer with a concentration in data analytics at George Mason University.
          The main reason I wanted to create this blog is to showcase my different interests that vary from time to time.
          "Jack of all trades, master of none"? Maybe, but I am a firm believer that you should try the things that interest you
          at an early age to figure out what you like before you get older and have more responsibilities.
          My interests that I try to do on a daily basis includes(but not limited to): videography, photography, music, soccer, learning to play the piano,
           working out, and kicking it back with friends.

          I love to talk and be around people. I love learning about everyone's story. I love the meaningful connection that I 
          am able to form with others. I believe that social media is a wonderful platform that allows us to stay connected
          like never before. We can be thousands of miles away from each other but still see each others faces. How amazing is that?!
          
          <br><br>
          I've learned that it's ok to take risk, it's ok to mess up, and it's ok to do the opposite of everyone else is doing.
          I have spent so much time trying to fit in with everyone else that now I am trying to fit out. I would say that 
          some of my goals and ambitions aren't what every 21 year old wants and I am completly fine with that 
          because it is about what you want, not your family or friends. Although, I am thankful to have family and friends
          that support my goals.

          <br><br>
          I am currently 21 years old and these are my thoughts on "Who I am" and obviously things can change
          because there is still a lot left to live for. I wanted to create this blog to inspire like-minded individuals and hopefully
          put a smile on at least one person's face every day.
